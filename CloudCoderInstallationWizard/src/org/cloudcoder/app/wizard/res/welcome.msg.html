<p>
Let's install CloudCoder!
You will need the following resources:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> account</li>
<li>Either the ability to create a DNS <b>A</b> record for the
server hosting the CloudCoder webapp, or an
account with <a href="http://www.noip.com/">No-IP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
You can check the <b>Do a dry run</b> checkbox if you just want
to see how the installation wizard works, without actually
installing CloudCoder.
