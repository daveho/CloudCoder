Check the <b>Enable integrated builder?</b> checkbox below if you want to enable an
integrated builder.

<p>
The builder is the component of CloudCoder that compiles and
tests submissions.  Enabling the integrated builder means that
a builder will run on the webapp server.  This is very
useful if you are just trying out CloudCoder, or if this
CloudCoder instance will have only very light use.

<p>
For production use, it is better to run builders on
dedicated computers.  Builders are CPU and memory intensive,
and running a builder on the webapp server can degrade
the performance of the webapp.
