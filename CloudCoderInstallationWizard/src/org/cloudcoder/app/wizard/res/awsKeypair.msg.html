You will need to choose a keypair to use to control access to
the server(s) to be provisioned for CloudCoder.
You can use an existing keypair associated with your AWS
account, or the installation wizard can create a new
keypair for you.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use an existing keypair, choose the <code>.pem</code>
file containing the keypair.  <b>Important</b>:
the filename must match the name of the keypair in your
AWS account.
</p>
<p>
If you do not use an existing keypair, the installation wizard
will create a new one for you, which will be called
<code>cloudcoder-keypair</code>.  Once the keypair is generated,
you will have the opportunity to save it to a file.  You
will need the keypair in order to connect to your servers
via ssh, so be sure to save it.
