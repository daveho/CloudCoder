<p>
Enter the hostname that you will use for your CloudCoder instance.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to use <a href="https://www.duckdns.org">Duck DNS</a>
to provide a DNS hostname for your CloudCoder instance,
check the <b>Use Duck DNS</b> checkbox, and then
enter your Duck DNS token as shown on your
<a href="https://www.duckdns.org/domains">Duck DNS account page</a>.
Note that the hostname must a subdomain of <code>duckdns.org</code>,
e.g. <code>myserver.duckdns.org</code>.
Duck DNS is a free service to provide DNS hostnames for
devices whose IP address may change dynamically.
Your CloudCoder instance's
IP address won't actually change, but Duck DNS is an easy
way to get a DNS hostname without registering a domain,
configuring a nameserver, etc.
</p>

<p>
If you do not choose to use Duck DNS, then you will need to
configure an <code>A</code> record for the hostname you choose.
The wizard will let you know what IP address to use once
the webapp server has been provisioned.
