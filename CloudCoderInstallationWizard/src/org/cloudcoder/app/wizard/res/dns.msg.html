<p>
Enter the hostname that you will use for your CloudCoder instance.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to use <a href="http://www.noip.com/">No-IP</a>
to provide a DNS hostname for your CloudCoder instance,
check the <b>Use No-IP</b> checkbox, and then
enter your No-IP username and password.
Note that the hostname must belong to one of the
domains that No-IP offers, e.g. <code>ddns.net</code>.
No-IP is a free service to provide DNS hostnames for
devices whose IP address may change dynamically.
Your CloudCoder instance's
IP address won't actually change, but No-IP is an easy
way to get a DNS hostname without registering a domain,
configuring a nameserver, etc.
</p>
<p>
If you do not choose to use No-IP, then you will need to
configure an <code>A</code> record for the hostname you choose.
The wizard will let you know what IP address to use once
the webapp server has been provisioned.
