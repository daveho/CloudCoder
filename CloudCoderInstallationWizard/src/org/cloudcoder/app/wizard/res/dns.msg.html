<p>
Enter the hostname that you will use for your CloudCoder instance.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to use <a href="http://www.noip.com/">No-IP</a>
to provide a DNS hostname for your CloudCoder instance,
enter your account information and hostname here.
No-IP is a free service to provide DNS hostnames for
devices whose IP address may change.  Your CloudCoder instance's
IP address won't actually change, but No-IP is an easy
way to get a DNS hostname without registering a domain,
configuring a nameserver, etc.
</p>
<p>
If you do not choose to use No-IP, then you will need to
configure an <tt>A</tt> record for the hostname you choose.
The wizard will let you know what IP address to use once
the webapp server has been provisioned.
