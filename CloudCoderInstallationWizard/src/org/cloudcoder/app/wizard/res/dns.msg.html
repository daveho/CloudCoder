<p>
Enter the hostname that you will use for your CloudCoder instance.
</p>

<p>
If you will be using a dynamic DNS provider such as
<a href="https://www.duckdns.org/">Duck DNS</a>, make sure that
the hostname matches the subdomain(s) offered by your
dynamic DNS provider.  For example, a Duck DNS hostname
should be something like <code><i>myserver</i>.duckdns.org</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you will not be using a dynamic DNS provider, then you will need to
configure an <code>A</code> record for the hostname you choose.
The wizard will let you know what IP address to use once
the webapp server has been provisioned.
