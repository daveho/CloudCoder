<p>
A key pair (PEM) file is needed to control access to the server(s)
used for the CloudCoder webapp and builders.
</p>
<p>
You can choose an existing keypair, or create a new one.
If you want to use an existing keypair, just enter its
name (<i>without</i> the <code>.pem</code> file extension).
If you choose to create a new keypair, it will be named
<code>cloudcoder-keypair</code>.
