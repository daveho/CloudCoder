<p>
Choose an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">EC2 instance type</a>
for the CloudCoder webapp/database server.
</p>

<p>
A <code>t2.micro</code> instance, which is eligible for the EC2 free
tier, is known to work well for CloudCoder if you have 60 or fewer
concurrent users.  It is likely that a <code>t2.nano</code>
instance will work reasonably well if you have a relatively
small number of concurrent users (perhaps 30 or so).  If you are
expecting a large number of concurrent users (100 or more)
you should consider using one of the larger instance types. 
</p>

<p>
Note that if you will have a significant number of concurrent
users, you will want to run some number of builders
separately (not on the webapp server.)  See [TODO: link to
documentation] for details on setting up builders.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Note that builder servers will be provisioned dynamically
as the webapp runs, and will incur additional charges depending
on use.  However, because builders do not run when not needed,
the cost of running the builders is likely to
be <i>much</i> lower than the cost of running the webapp.
(Dynamic scaling FTW!)
