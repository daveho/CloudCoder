It looks like you have run the CloudCoder installation wizard
previously.  Check the box labeled <b>Load previous values</b>
if you would like to load the previous values.

This is a very good idea if you are re-running the installation
wizard to issue and install a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate,
since you won't have to enter all of your configuration values
again.
