This page allows you to choose a dynamic DNS provider.
This is the easiest way to configure a DNS hostname for your
CloudCoder instance.  We highly recommend using dynamic
DNS if you are just trying out CloudCoder.  It's easy and
free!

<p>
If you do not choose to use a dynamic DNS provider, you will
need to create a DNS <code>A</code> record to associate
a hostname with the public IP address of the CloudCoder
server (once it is provisioned).

If you <em>do</em> choose to use a dynamic DNS provider,
you should create an account with that provider (if you haven't
already) and create a hostname for your CloudCoder instance.
You'll also need your account credentials.
