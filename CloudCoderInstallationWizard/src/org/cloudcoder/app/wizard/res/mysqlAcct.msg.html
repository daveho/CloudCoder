Choose passwords for the MySQL <code>root</code> and
<code>cloudcoder</code> accounts.  The <code>root</code> account
is the MySQL superuser, and the <code>cloudcoder</code>
user is the account the CloudCoder webapp uses to access
the database.

The MySQL database is not exposed to external clients,
so it's not terribly important to use strong passwords here.
If you would like to keep the default values (which is
<code>abc123</code> for both passwords), that should be fine.
