<p>
This page allows you to choose a dynamic DNS provider.
This is the easiest way to configure a DNS hostname for your
CloudCoder instance.  We highly recommend using dynamic
DNS if you are just trying out CloudCoder.  It's easy and
free!
</p>

<p>
If you choose to use a dynamic DNS provider,
you should create an account with that provider (if you haven't
already) and create a hostname for your CloudCoder instance.
You'll also need your account credentials.

<p>
If you don't use a dynamic DNS provider, you'll need to
create a DNS entry for the CloudCoder webapp once it is
provisioned.
